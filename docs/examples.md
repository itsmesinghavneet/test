This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Structure of an Example](#structure-of-an-example)
* [How to Use the Examples](#how-to-use-the-examples)

## Structure of an Example

Under a descriptive title, each example comprises the following sections:

### Resource Fields

Includes the writeable fields that you can key in while creating and the read only fields that you cannot edit along with their type.

### Operations

The tasks that you can perform such as creating, editing, or deleting endpoints.

### Actions

The actions you can perform such as activating or deactivating endpoints.

## How to Use the Examples

This following sections are a collection of examples-recipes, if you will-for using REST API, a server-side scripting solution for use with MayaOnline. You can use the following sections in at least three ways:

* You can follow the examples as written \(substituting your own variables, of course\) to complete tasks without necessarily knowing everything about the steps you are following.
* You can use the examples as templates and adapt them to similar tasks in your work.
* You can study the examples to figure out “how things are done” in REST API and generalize to using different methods for other tasks you need to script.

The examples are chosen to illustrate common use cases and are intended to facilitate all three of these modes of use.
